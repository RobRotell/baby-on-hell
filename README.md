# Annona
Simple progressive web app for creating a grocery list.

Right now, this can work locally and with an account through the [API](https://github.com/RobRotell/annona-api). Right now, only I have an account, but sometime in the future, I hope to open this up for anyone to use.

Visit [Annona](https://annona.robr.app/) in your browser of choice (assuming you're not using iOS), click "Install App", and save grocery items for your next trip!
